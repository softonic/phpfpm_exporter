# phpfpm_exporter
Prometheus exporter for php-fpm status information. If you are running php-fpm with nginx webserver (or any other webserver), and have configured your php-fpm to serve status information, phpfpm_exporter will export the status information into a format that prometheus can read.

# Installation

You will need to have Go http://golang.org.

Checkout the source:

    git clone https://github.com/craigmj/phpfpm_exporter

Build the code:

    cd phpfpm_exporter
    ./build.sh

Now you've got the binary in `bin/phpfpm_exporter`

# Running

Because this is a Go application, you only need the binary. So you can copy that to your server, which needs to be configured to report php-fpm status information.

Start the exporter with

	phpfpm_exporter

## Running from Docker

This service is provided as a docker image that can be run with the command

    docker run --rm softonic/phpfpm_exporter \
      -status.url=http://nginx/status?json \
      -listen.address 0.0.0.0:9099

Just change the example parameters to fit your use case.

# Command Line Options

The exporter accepts 3 command line options

* `status.url`	The URL from which to scrape the php-fpm status. Defaults to `http://localhost/status?json`. It is essential that you have the `?json` parameter in the URL, so that phpfpm_exporter can parse the returned values.

* `listen.address`	The address on which to serve the php-fpm metrics to prometheus. Defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:9099/`

* `scrape.interval`	The interval between scraps of the php-fpm status. Defaults to `5m`. You can set any string value that can be parsed by Go's Duration class: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration

# Configuring Prometheus

Assuming you're running prometheus on the same server as your phpfpm_exporter, you need to add to your `scrape_configs` in `prometheus.yml`:

    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'fpm'
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['127.0.0.1:9099']

Obviously the targets value should match the `listen.address` command line option you've set for phpfpm_exporter.

# Metrics

The phpfpm_exporter exports the following metrics to prometheus:

## phpfpm_acceptedconnections_count

The number of connections accepted by the `pool`.

### Time Series labels

* `pool`: the fpm pool

## phpfpm_listenqueue_size

The size of the listen queue for each pool.

### Time Series labels

* `pool` the fpm pool

* `metric` one of

  * `current` : the `listen queue` value from php-fpm: the number of requests in the queue of pending connections

  * `max` : the `max listen queue` value from php-fpm: the maximum number of requests in the queue of pending connections since FPM started

  * `len` : the `listen queue len` value from php-fpm: the size of the socket queue of pending connections

## phpfpm_processes_count

The number of processes in each pool.

### Time Series labels

* `pool` : the fpm pool

* `state` : the state of the proceses. One of

   * `idle`: the number of idle processes

   *`active`: the number of active processes

   *`max_active`: the maximum number of active processes in this pool since fpm started

Note that we don't reflect the `total processes` as reported by php-fpm, since that is simply `idle`+`active` and can thus be calculated.

## phpfpm_maxchildren_count

The maximum number of child processes reached in the pool.

### Time Series labels

* `pool`: the fpm pool
